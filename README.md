## Data Selection 

**Reason why they selected their topic:**

We selected this topic becuase we found it interesting and thought it would be a great machine learning project. This data set has mulitpe features and we found it possible to merge with an additional data set by the postal code.  


**Description of their source of data**

The source was found on the [Link to website](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i?row_index=0). This website hosts multipe data sets on the San Francisco area.
